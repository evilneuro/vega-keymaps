Keymap files for the ZX Spectrum Vega+

Some zxk files have been posted on Indiegogo to help those provided with blank ZX Spectrum Vega+ handhelds. I thought it might be a good idea to start a repository of those files and have somewhere to collaborate on adding more.

Feel free to fork and PR any changes or additions, and we can start building these out.  Please ensure any content provided is not of commercial origin so as to avoid any conflicts of interest or unnecessary legal issues.
