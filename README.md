Keymap files for the ZX Spectrum Vega+

Some zxk files have been posted on Indiegogo to help those provided with blank ZX Spectrum Vega+ handhelds. I thought it might be a good idea to start a repository of those files and have somewhere to collaborate on adding more.

The filename convention under the `keymaps` directory is `zxdb id filled to length 8` dash `programme name in lower case stripped of punctuation with dashes instead of spaces`, e.g. *Elite*, which has an ID in ZXDB of 1601, would be `00001601-elite.zxk`, while *Garfield - Big, Fat, Hairy Deal* (ID 1977) would be `00001977-garfield-big-fat-hairy-deal.zxk`

The filename field in each zxk file would need modified to match whatever was being loaded onto SD card, but this can possibly be mitigated by using a generator with these files as templates.

Further discussion of keymap format and usage can be found in `KEYMAPS.md`
